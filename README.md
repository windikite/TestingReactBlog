My 50th assignment! In this project, I upgrade the 49th assignment (the data fetching blog) to take advantage of performance optimization features within react such as Memoization.

The PostList component has now been upgraded to prevent unnecessary recalculations of the filtered list as long as the userId remains the same. 

Task2 WIP while assignment is updated.

Task3 WIP while assignemnt is updated. PostContent exists and but I need to be sure it is actually what is wanted for the project. 

I will resubmit when I am sure what this project is fully asking for, as some components are referenced that were not mentioned previously. 

Running this application is easy, just install dependencies and then 'npm run dev' in the terminal.
